** * Personal Details * **
---------------------------

My current purpose lies with the desire to work as a freeelancer 
whereby building up my personal brand. And since I intend to get on
in content management and web marketing I reckon it would be highly 
useful to grow somewhat educated in the related sectors, such as 
back- and front-end code writing. I'm greedy to learn how it all functions
and gets adjusted on the other side of interface.

Previously I didn't had much to do with computers, not much as an expert anyway
rather a user. But I'm capable of learning new things starting prompt from the 
scratch. 
I have had a couple qualifications in my life which I got a strong command of. 
I was a language tutor and translator, furniture maker and interior designer
and some more. So I will gain my point mastering skills and knowledges from the IT 
field though it is quite a novelty to me.


** * Programming languages/skills * **
---------------------------------------

No completely learnt languages. I merely studuied basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS
as part of RSS JavaScript back-end course.


** * Education * **

1995 - 2000, Southern Ukraine Pedagogical University.
Graduated as a language expert and teacher majoring in German and English.

** * Level of knowledge of the English language * **
